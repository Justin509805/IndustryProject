**User Analysis.**

**1.	Defining our objectives**
Understanding our users and their needs could result in a much better or improved product. Knowing what the users want can lead to increased user satisfaction. And they are most likely to be more engaged with our product. By identifying pain points and user preferences we can create a better user experience/ux and prevent losing user satisfaction. 

After this research we would like to have our target audience identified, know their needs for our product and in the end have better user satisfaction and a more improved product.

**2.	Identify our target audience, who, when, where.**
Demographic characteristics: 
1.	Age: Primarily people aged between 14-65+, this because sensory overload can occur to all people and isnâ€™t for a set specific age. However it is important to keep age-related factors in mind.

2.	Occupation: Since sensory overload can happen to everyone, the occupation is very diverse. It includes professionals, students, employees, retirees, individuals with special needs. 

3.	Lifestyle: People who have sensory overload tend to have a very quiet lifestyle and try not to be busy for a long period of time. They may seek places with minimal sensory stimuli and include periods of rest and relaxation in their daily routine.

4.	Geographic location: While sensory overload can occur on any location, people who live in an urban environment may have a harder time with overloading since there is more stimulation such as noise, crowds and visual stimuli. However, these could also happen in rural and suburban areas.

5.	Health conditions: Sensory overload can be associated with various health conditions such as, autism spectrum disorders, ADHD, anxiety and PTSD. 




**Psychographic characteristics:**
1.	Tech-Savvy: Comfortable with technology, particularly mobile devices, which may serve as tools to manage their sensory overload such as apps, sensory regulation tools and noise-cancelation headphones. 

2.	Surrounding Consciousness: Very aware of their environment, tend to surround themselves in as less busy places as possible. Individuals with sensory overload may seek out environments with minimal stimulation, minimal background noise, subdued lighting and less triggers.

3.	Socially Conscious: Value social interaction but in moderation since too much can lead to overload. They may prefer quality over quantity with their interactions.

4.	Coping Strategies: They might use some coping strategies to get less stimuli such as deep breathing, self-regulation and seeking out sensory-friendly environments.


**3.	Choosing research methods**
The research methods that we went with are:
-	Survey
-	Interviews
-	User observation
-	Target Group

**4.	Conducting research**
Within this step, we will administer surveys, conduct interviews, facilitate target groups and observe users in their natural environment. While doing these steps we will make sure that our participants represent our target audience. 

**5.	Analyse data**
We have got information via surveys, interviews, user-scenario testing, feedback from users, teachers, peers and stakeholders. We have analysed all of the data and made sure to take these into account when making our prototype. We have a lot of iterations based on feedback from our teacher, users and stakeholders and are now left with a good final version. 


**6.	Create Personas:**

**7.	Iterate and Validate**
We have used the insights that we have gained from our user research to improve our design and development process. We made sure to keep testing and testing our product with real users and iterate.

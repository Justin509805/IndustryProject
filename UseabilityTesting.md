**The scenario that the users got:**
Lately you have been experiencing sensory overload. You have break at your job at a pub where there is a lot of stimuli coming in. You really needed that break because you just had an overload. You want to input your experience in the app. 

My motivation for this test: We want to know if our users understand our app and which improvement points they have about it.

**Our User’s goals:**
Primary

1.	Input a new trigger
2.	Create a planning
   
Secondary

1.	See an overview of their triggers and activities

**User Scenario 1**
Identifying User Persona:
https://github.com/jraemakers/industry-project-krom2/blob/main/Research/Analysis/Lauren.png 
This persona is based on one of our users. Her name is Milou, she is a colleague of mine. She has PDD-NOS which is a form of autism and she gets overloaded a lot, especially at work, which is why she only works half a day.

User’s journey
The users opens our app. She looks down on the screen and wants to login with Google. After that she was met with the dairy page where she looks a bit unpleasant. She was given the task to input a new trigger, she looked for around 10 seconds and then found the + button. She gave a positive look at the screen and was guided through the pages. She filled in the senses, the current day and the time. Looked a bit questionable when we asked for her location. She spoke to the phone and she described her situation. 

After the first goal was finished we told her if she could make a planning. 
She filled in the date and time, filled in a title, place and a checklist. She was asked if she could see what she had planned for tomorrow. She clicked on the right date and got all the information that she needed. She overall looked happy and positive. 

Finally, she went to her last goal which was seeing which triggers she have had recently and she opened the right page and got all the information she wanted. This action was really quick compared to the others. 

Issues: She had a bit of trouble finding the + button to add a new trigger. 
Potential issues: Too much information at the overview. Background could be too distracting.

Conclusion
Outcome: Had an overall good experience, she liked that she was guided through adding her trigger. Creating her planning went well and she accomplished all her goals in the end.
Feedback: Change the background colour to only one, make the + button more obvious.



**User Scenario 2**
Identifying User Persona:
https://github.com/jraemakers/industry-project-krom2/blob/main/Research/Analysis/mike.png 
This persona is based on one of our users. His name is Ivo, he is my father, and he don’t like to go to public places because it too busy. So, if we go to a restaurant he rather stays home because he gets overloaded.


User journey
First, the user opens the app. He reads the welcome message and clicks on Let’s Get Started. He is directed to the home screen; he looks around, but he doesn’t know what to do. The icons aren’t clear the user and what does icon do. After a while he figured out how to add a new trigger. He sees a doctor who asked questions, he looked surprised. He suggests using a different image because he doesn’t like the feeling he needs a doctor. He filles in the field and pressed on next. Then change his minded and want to edit the answer but he can’t go back. After answering all the questions, he adds a trigger. True the main menu he goes to the planning page. He fills in the needed data to add an item to the planning. After adding the item, he looks at the planning and he said that it feels a bit messy.

Issues:
In the beginning he doesn’t know what to do but after some explaining everything went well. There should be an option to go back.

Conclusion:
In the home screen I wasn’t verry clear what to do. He doesn’t like the feeling of the doctor and there wasn’t a way back when adding a trigger. The planning looks a bit messy.





**User Scenario 3**
Identifying User Persona:
https://github.com/jraemakers/industry-project-krom2/blob/main/Research/Analysis/james.png 
This persona is based on one of our users. His name is Lars, and he has ADHD. Because Lars has ADHD, he is extra sensitive for triggers.
User journey
Lars opens the app and reads the welcome message. He presses Let’s Get Started and is directed to the homepage. When he sees the homepage with a big graph but doesn’t know wat it represents. After looking around still is clear and presses the add button the add a trigger. He fills in the question but struggled a bit to answer the question where he must describe what exactly happened. There isn’t any further explanation so he fills in how he thinks it should. After completing the question, he returns to the homepage and sees that some things are changed. Lars goes to the planning page and tries to add an item. This went very smoothly, and he hasn’t any struggles filling it in. 

Issues: 
He has issues reading the graph and filling in what exactly happened.

Conclusion:
The graph should be easily readable and maybe help people with answering what happened to them.


**Final Conclusion and what’s next:**
When comparing all three tests you notice that our users run into some problems. Most problems relate to somethings not being clear or too much information. Graphs which aren’t clear, things on the screen which give of more stimulation, not knowing where curtain buttons are.

For our iterations we will be making sure to make a simpler and more clear version and we will test it with user-scenarios as well.
